What is CrossOrigin in script tag?
The crossorigin attribute in the <script> tag is used to specify how the browser should handle loading the script if it is hosted on a different domain than the one serving the web page. This attribute is particularly relevant in the context of security and preventing potential security vulnerabilities like Cross-Origin Scripting (XSS) attacks.
When you include a <script> tag to load an external JavaScript file, the browser generally enforces a same-origin policy. This policy means that scripts can only be loaded from the same domain, protocol, and port as the web page itself. If you try to load a script from a different domain without proper configuration, the browser might block the request due to security concerns.
