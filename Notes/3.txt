What is difference between `dependencies` vs `devDependencies`?
-dependencies:
    -packages that are needed by project to run in production
    -when deployed, package manager will install these in the production environment

-devDependencies:
    -packages needed only for development and testing
    -ex:testing frameworks, build tools

-To run a project in diffferent environment, both dependencies and devDependencies will be installed in the system.
-But for production environment, only dependencies will be installed, keeping the environment lean and avoid unncecessary packages.

-package.json defines the project configuration and the intended versions of dependencies
-package-lock.json is used to lock the dependency versions and provide a consistent and reproducible environment for the project.


^ - caret and ~ - tilda
-The caret operator is useful when you want to ensure compatibility with newer versions that may introduce new features or fixes while avoiding major version updates, which might include breaking changes.
-The tilde operator is useful when you want to stay up-to-date with bug fixes and patches while avoiding updates that might include new features or breaking changes.
